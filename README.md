## My process

To complete this project, I first started by using CodePly.com to figure out the layout for the grid component. I played around with the divs, cols and rows. Then I went on to styling the project. I styled one box at a time, starting with the top box and so forth. After The design looked close to the final design, I went ahead and started figuring out the responsivesness for smaller screens. 

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### Continued development

Need to work on Flexbox and Grid.

### Useful resources

- [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.1/layout/grid/) - This helped me to understand using Grid layout.
- [Codeply](https://www.codeply.com/p?starter=Bootstrap%205) - Great editor to use if you dont want to have to keep deleting code. And to also get a rough draft of how you want your project to look.
